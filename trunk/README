1. Requirements:
 * SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/)
 * SDL_ttf (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)
 * SDL_draw (http://sdl-draw.sourceforge.net/)
 * C compiler.
2. Compilation:
 * You need to specify standard - c99. For gcc, use parameter -std=c99.
 * Example command line for gcc is in compile file. It can be used to compile
   on POSIX systems.
3. Usage:
 * Available functions are specified in functions.txt (this name can be changed
   in source code, in FUNCTION_FILE constant.There are some symblos can be used:
     - x,y - variables
     - x^n, y^n - variables rised to power n, 1<n<10.
     - sin(..) - sinus of statement in parenthesis.
     - cos(..) - cosinus of statement in parenthesis.
     - sin^n(..) and cos^n(..) - for sinus and cosinus in n-th power, 1<n<10.
     - ln(..) - natural logarithm of statement in parenthesis
     - /(..) - divides everything before "/" by statement in parenthesis.
     - +/- - addition, substraction of monomials.
     - (..) - makes statement in parenthesis be calculated first.
   two symbols connected without +/- are multiplied (mades monomial).

 * You can move camera with + and - buttons by X and Y.
 * You can zoom in and zoom out with "Zoom in" and "Zoom out" buttons.
 * You can change current function, by click on f'(x,y)=. Right click for next,
   left click for previous.
 * You can draw curve by clicking point included by wanted curve.
